## What is "Tell Me Why" ?

It is one of the most addictive lines from the most famous song of the **Backstreet Boys**- _"I want It That Way"_

## _"I want It That Way"_ (Original)

"I Want It That Way" is a song by American vocal group Backstreet Boys. It was released on April 12, 1999, as the lead single from their third studio album, Millennium. It was written by Max Martin and Andreas Carlsson, while Martin and Kristian Lundin produced it. The pop ballad tells of a romantic relationship strained by matters of emotional or physical distance.

Critically, the song was met with positive reception, with many critics commending its catchiness, also calling it the pop ballad of the year.  The song was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Song and Record of the Year, and has been included in lists by Blender, MTV, Rolling Stone and VH1. In 2021, "I Want It That Way" was placed at number 240 on the revised list of Rolling Stone's "500 Greatest Songs of All Time".

"I Want It That Way" is the Backstreet Boys' signature song, and commercially it reached the number-one spot in more than 25 countries, including **Who even reads this much content, just head over to the bottom of the page and see the youtube video bruh.**Austria, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the song peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for eight non-consecutive weeks, while it topped the Adult and Mainstream Top 40 charts.

The song has been widely covered and parodied by a range of artists, including other boy bands such as JLS and One Direction, while its music video, directed by Wayne Isham, received famous parodies, including Blink-182 in their music video for "All the Small Things",  Big Time Rush in their music videos for "Like Nobody's Around" and "Worldwide", and The Wanted in their video for "Walks Like Rihanna". The original music video received four VMA nominations, winning Viewer's Choice. It became the group's first music video to surpass one billion views on YouTube in 2021.

From Emmy Award-winning writer/producers Dan Goor and Michael Schur ("Parks and Recreation"), and starring Emmy Award winners Andy Samberg ("Saturday Night Live") and Andre Braugher ("Men of a Certain Age," "Homicide: Life on the Street"), BROOKLYN NINE-NINE is a new single-camera ensemble comedy about what happens when a talented, but carefree, detective gets a new captain with a lot to prove. 

### Premise
Set in the fictional 99th Precinct of the New York City Police Department in Brooklyn, Brooklyn Nine-Nine follows a team of detectives headed by the serious and intellectual Captain Raymond Holt, who is assigned as their new commanding officer in the pilot episode. The outside of the precinct is based on the 78th Precinct in Brooklyn, as the 99th Precinct is not real.
