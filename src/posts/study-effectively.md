### 1. Get organised

Taking the time to get organised will set you up well and help you achieve your learning goals.

Top study tips:

    Invest in a diary, and use it to keep track of current assignment deadlines.
    Bring all the material and devices you need to class, so you can participate. You may find it helpful to pack your bag the night before, so you’re ready to go first thing in the morning.


### 2. Don’t skip class! (OFC)

Skipping class can be detrimental to your learning and achieving your study goals. It leaves gaping holes in your notes – and in your subject knowledge.

Remember to practise active listening by focusing on what your teachers are saying in class and taking notes as needed.

### 3. Take notes

To keep your brain engaged during class, take notes, which you can refer to later, as you refine your study techniques.


### 4. Talk to your teacher & ask questions

Your teacher is, in a way, a resource who is there to be used!

Your teacher will no doubt be impressed with your initiative and happy to help.

Improve your study technique by asking questions in class.
### 5. Space out your studying

One of the most effective ways of studying is to space out your learning sessions.

If you break up your study load over several days, you’ll retain information far more readily than if you crammed in one long session.

You’ll find you achieve much better results for it.
### 6. Create a study plan – & stick to it

One top study tip is to create a schedule or plan.

This is incredibly helpful for time management and can help you reach your learning goals.

A study plan will:

    motivate you to study, as you’ll have time dedicated to learning
    keep you organised around work, hobbies and other commitments, as you can plan ahead
    break your study load into manageable blocks
    give you time to complete your assignments, ensuring they’re not rushed or last-minute.


### 7. Don’t just re-read but study

When you are reading and re-reading texts and notes, you’re not studying. This is because you’re not engaging with the material.

You’ll discover that you have trouble remembering class notes if you’re not using active studying techniques.

Instead of reading, try:

    creating concept maps and diagrams
    explaining concepts to yourself step by step
    formulating questions and problems that you can come back to and solve, effectively creating a quiz for yourself
    becoming a teacher or tutor to your study group or partner and learning the course material by explaining concepts to them.

Use active studying techniques to really engage with your notes.
### 8. Set up a quiet study space

It is important to have a designated study area that is free from distraction and will allow you to study effectively.

When you settle into your study area, you will know you are there to learn. This mindset will help with your overall motivation to study.

You can also try out VU’s student lounges and learning spaces.

### 9. Test yourself

Getting someone to quiz you – or quizzing yourself – is great retrieval practice. This learning technique helps you commit information to your long-term memory and easily retrieve it when needed.


### 10. Find a study buddy or join a study group

One of the best ways to study is to share the experience with another person.

It can be beneficial to find a study buddy – or even form a study group with like-minded students.

Your study buddy/group can:

    keep you motivated
    help you stay accountable
    quiz and test you on course material
    read over your work to offer advice
    share resources, such as textbooks, lowering expenses.

Study effectively with the help of like-minded students.
