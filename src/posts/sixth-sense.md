# Sixth Sense Technology

**Note: This is not biological sixth sense just a start of a new technological era with a wearable computing device.**

It's the start of a new technological era in which engineering will reach new heights. All of this will be possible very soon, just like in science fiction movies where computer screens appear on walls, commands are given through gestures, the smart digital environment talks to us to do our work, and so on. 

## What is a Sixth Sense? 

Steve Mann is regarded as the **"Father of Sixth Sense Technology,"** having created a wearable computing device in 1990. People are aware that various technologies have been used to develop a method of integrating humans and robots. 
 
Controlling robotic vehicles with gestures is a popular method of improving integration. Human gesture improves human-robot interaction by removing the need for input devices. The system's built-in camera is used to capture real-time video of gestures.  

It combines technologies such as hand gesture recognition, image capture, processing, and manipulation. Color markers are used to highlight the movements of the gestures. 

## Applications of Sixth Sense Technology

There are a wide range of applications of Sixth Sense Technology, many of which are particularly relevant in today's world. Among these are:

-**Making a phone call**
There is no need to physically take out the phone to make a call when using this technology. Using Sixth Sense, one can quickly and easily contact another person. 

-**Using the map to search**

This function can be used to plot a course, search for locations, locate the most viable paths, and provide navigation assistance, to name a few.

-**Application for Drawing**

Using this device, one can express artistic abilities at any time and from any location. The companion app draws and projects images on available surfaces. Drawings saved in the device memory can be accessed at any time.

-**Taking a Photograph**

The camera is used to capture an image of the scene that the user is viewing. When the user's four fingertips form a rectangular frame, the camera recognises it as a frame-capturing gesture and performs the appropriate task.
 
Sixth Sense technology is the science of the future, with the potential to usher in a new era in technology. This technology has the potential to completely transform the way humans interact with the real world and provide everyone with complete awareness of their surroundings.
